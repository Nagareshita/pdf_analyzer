## 🎬 Quick Start


```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel, AutoProcessor
from PIL import Image


model_path = "your model path"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True)
device = torch.cuda.current_device()
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,).to(device)

print("##### with images")
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "image", "image": 'image_path'}, 
    {"type": "text", "text": "describe the image"}]}
]
text = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)

image_path = 'your image path'
image = Image.open(image_path)
inputs = processor(images=image, text=text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True).to(model.device).to(torch.bfloat16)

generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=512)
response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
response = response.split('<|im_end|>')[0].strip()
print(response)


print("##### without images")
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "中国的首都是哪里？"}]
    }
]
text = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)
inputs = processor(images=None, text=text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True).to(model.device).to(torch.bfloat16)
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=512)
response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
response = response.split('<|im_end|>')[0].strip()

## 👀 Introduction
- **SAIL-VL2 is powerful yet efficient:** With training on 776B tokens, SAIL-VL2 has verified its effectiveness across 106 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on a broad spectrum of influential benchmarks under the 2B-parameter scale. Remarkably, even without specialized prompting, the base SAIL-VL2 model delivers highly competitive performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as MMMU and MathVista, demonstrating strong out-of-the-box capabilities.

- **SAIL-VL2 as a deep thinker:** Many real-world tasks demand sophisticated reasoning and multi-step thought processes, which remain challenging for standard LVMs. To address this, we develop SAIL-VL2-Thinking, a specialized variant trained with advanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) strategies. This design substantially improves performance on complex reasoning benchmarks, often matching or even surpassing models with far larger parameter scales, thereby setting a new standard for efficient architectures in high-level reasoning.

- **SAIL-VL2 perceives with clarity:** Fine-grained visual understanding is a critical challenge for multimodal models. SAIL-VL2 delivers high-fidelity perception in tasks such as OCR, high-resolution document layout analysis, and complex chart interpretation, achieving detailed visual grounding beyond models of similar scale.

  <i> Overview of the SAIL-VL2 framework. The architecture is composed of a vision encoder that aligns visual inputs into the representation space of the LLM. A lightweight adapter further transforms visual embeddings into tokenized representations, which are jointly processed with linguistic embeddings for multimodal reasoning and prediction. SAIL-VL2 accommodates multiple LLM backbones, ensuring flexibility and scalability across model configurations.</i>

## 📚 Training Strategy
### 🌟 Data construction

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/figures/data.png" width="100%" alt="SAIL-VL2 Data">
  <i> Data construction pipeline for SAIL-VL2 training. High-quality multimodal corpora are construted by curating and filtering open-source datasets, and generating synthetic data, with both components systematically organized to meet the requirements of different training stages.</i>
</div>

### 🌟 Pre-Train

- **Basic Multimodal Pre-Training:** develops SAIL-VL2’s multimodal alignment via SAIL-ViT, LLM and a random MLP adapter, using 64M samples, AdaLRS and 2048 batch size.

- **Multi-task Pre-Training:** strengthens SAIL-VL2’s visual and instruction-following abilities, unfreezes all params, adds instruction-tuning data, uses 180M samples, and skips AdaLRS.

  <i> Scaling curves of SAIL-VL2-2B during the multi-task pre-training stage. Results are reported on overall benchmarks, natural-scene VQA datasets, and OCR VQA tasks. ’BMK Score’ denotes the average benchmark score.</i>
</div>


### 🌟 Post-Train

- **Basic Supervised Fine-Tuning:** 4 phases; Model Soup merges homogeneous models.

- **LongCoT Supervised Fine-tuning:** enhances the model’s step-by-step reasoning capabilities for complex problems.

- **RL with Verifiable Rewards:** refines the model by optimizing it against a reward system focused on two primary objectives: the correctness of the final answer and adherence to the specified output format

- **Think-Fusion Supervised Fine-tuning:** enhances the model’s reasoning capabilities while maintaining its broad general understanding.

- **RL with a Mixed Reward System:** enhances the model’s reasoning capabilities through a RL stage
